# ANN Project Implementation - Churn Modelling-

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn in a business setting. Customer churn refers to the loss of clients or customers, and being able to predict churn can be crucial for companies looking to maintain their customer base. By implementing an ANN, this project aims to identify patterns in customer behavior that lead to churn, allowing businesses to take proactive measures to retain customers.

## Key Objectives

- Develop a robust ANN model capable of predicting customer churn with high accuracy.
- Analyze and preprocess the dataset to ensure optimal model performance.
- Implement the ANN model using a deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras).
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Provide insights into the factors contributing to customer churn.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains customer data from a telecom company, including features such as customer tenure, monthly charges, payment methods, and more. The target variable is a binary indicator of whether the customer has churned (1) or not (0).

## Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing:** 
  - Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
  
- **Model Building:**
  - Designing the ANN architecture, including input layers, hidden layers, and output layers.
  - Selecting appropriate activation functions, optimizers, and loss functions.

- **Training and Evaluation:**
  - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - Training the ANN model and evaluating its performance on the test data.
  - Fine-tuning the model to improve accuracy and generalization.

- **Results and Interpretation:**
  - Analyzing the model's predictions and identifying key factors that influence churn.
  - Visualizing the performance metrics and understanding the model's strengths and limitations.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for model evaluation

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the implementation of an ANN for churn modeling, providing a powerful tool for businesses to predict and prevent customer churn. By understanding the factors that contribute to churn, companies can make data-driven decisions to enhance customer retention strategies.

## Future Work

- Experiment with different neural network architectures to improve prediction accuracy.
- Explore other machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) for comparison.
- Implement a real-time churn prediction system integrated with business applications.
